## About

Want to play a quick game of Tic Tac Toe in your browser? Bored with the standard "X" and "O" markers? Well then, do I have some good news for you! This application is a cute "Frogs vs. Flies" version of Tic Tac Toe that you can easily play with a friend right in your browser!

This project was created as a solution to an assignment in the Full Stack JavaScript Course by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). The assignment criteria called for a tic-tac-toe game that uses as little global code as possible, and to create the game using factory functions wrapped inside an IIFE.

### Built With

## Usage

This game plays in all the same ways of traditional Tic Tac Toe. The frog icons equate to "X"s and the fly icons equate to "O"s. Player 1 will always be frogs and Player 2 will always be flies. 

Select an empty square to place your marker. Line up 3 of your markers in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - to win the game!
